Brandon heard about the Karma website from a fellow University Professor.  He decided to join in order to offer tutoring lessons to needy students.  This would help him get better at tutoring.  

##Use case 1:

- Input “math” into the  ‘search” bar with the filter “need” and “closest to location” to find people on the site affiliated with math. He figured he could tutor in person.  Though, if no one was close enough, could offer help over the phone or through Skype.
